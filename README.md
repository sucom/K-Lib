#K-Lib

K-Lib is a javascript library to speed up the web application development.

##Declarative
K-Lib's "render" uses declarative paradigm that makes it easier to structure your application.

##Flexible
K-Lib is built on libraries you already know and love like jQuery and lodash.

##Simplicity
K-Lib's "render" method takes few input data and renders what to display by doing all the magic behind the scene. You don't have to worry about different Template's rendering code or even ajax calls.

##Efficient
K-Lib's "render" approach takes care of all of your resource loading. You don't have to load all at once. Load partial html, css, and javascript when its needed (with/without caching).


##API Documentation
All the documentation is located on the [Official site](http://k-lib.info/ "K-Lib Official Site"). K-Lib is just not for rendering, it has few additional methods, which are very useful in your front-end DOM manipulation. So have a look there for help on how to get started, API documentation, example and peruse the reference doc.
 
##Dependencies
K-Lib is built on top of jQuery and lodash. visit [Official site](http://k-lib.info/ "K-Lib Official Site") to get started.
